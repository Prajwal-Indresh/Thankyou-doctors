			  <p><b>Kudos</b> to doctors and nurses working in gruelling shifts and barely getting enough sleep or rest. Doctors and nurses working in hospitals and that too in wards with the Coronavirus patients, have been going through a hard time and are completely exhausted by the time their day ends. According to a report by the IE, many nurses, when they go back to their block to sleep, have stretch marks and bruises on their face due to wearing the masks and goggles stretched across their faces continuously. Not only this, in some cases, the limbs ache too from wearing PPE suits which may be available in a smaller size. The report said that healthcare workers dread taking a shower too as that would moisturize their body and increase the risk of infection if they have any viral residual on their body.</p>
